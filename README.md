# Shiny App for analysing the airquality Dataset

This peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, I had to create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, I used Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about the application.

## Shiny App for analysing the airquality Dataset

This shinyapp lets you explore the relationship between Ozone and the five other variables recorded in the airquality dataset. 

- Choose any variable to see a scatter plot of the linear relationship between Ozone and the Chosen Variable. 

- Tick the 'Show all...' box to see the summary statistics for the chosen linear relationship.

to run the app, click on the following link https://kevmaher.shinyapps.io/APPNAME/

## Presentation of how to use the Shiny App for analysing the airquality Dataset

I created the presentation using Rstudio Presenter. The presentenation is published at http://rpubs.com/kevinmaher/shiny
