# ShinyAppInstructions

This peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, I had to create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, I used Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about the application.

Shiny App for analysing the airquality Dataset


The Shiny application in question is entirely up to you. However, if you're having trouble coming up with ideas, you could start from the simple prediction algorithm done in class and build a new algorithm on one of the R datasets packages. Please make the package simple for the end user, so that they don't need a lot of your prerequisite knowledge to evaluate your application. You should emphasize a simple project given the short time frame.

Presentation of how to use the Shiny App for analysing the airquality Dataset

OK, you've made your shiny app, now it's time to make your pitch. You get 5 slides (inclusive of the title slide) to pitch a your app. You're going to create a web page using Slidify or Rstudio Presenter with an html5 slide deck.
